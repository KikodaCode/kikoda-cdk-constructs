2. If you're using an editor that supports [Dev Containers](https://devcontainers.github.io), you can optionally start your editor with the provided Dev Container configuratiuon. If not, be sure to install dependencies with `yarn install`.

4. Run unit tests with `yarn test`.
5. Manually test your changes using CDK commands such as `cdk synth`, `cdk diff`, and `cdk deploy`.
